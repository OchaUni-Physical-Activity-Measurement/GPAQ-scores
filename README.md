# How to obtain MET-min/week using GPAQ scores


GPAQ questionnaires assess the physical activity (PA) behavior during work, displacements or hobbies.
You can then obtain the number of minutes per week spend practicing moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA), or no physical activity; then translate it into MET/min/week.  
  
To do so, you need to:
* transpose the questionnaires into .csv files and put them all in the same folder (see sample/)
* use the code provided (**Scoring GPAQ.ipynb**) on your transposed .csv files to obtain the energy expenditure over a week (see results/). You have to precise the path of the folder where all the .csv are, and the path where you want to save the result
